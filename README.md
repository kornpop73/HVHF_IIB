# HVHF_IIB
* Single-ended 65Vpp, 5ns amplifier with multiple output stages capable of driving capacitive loads up to 100pF. 
* This design is based on the circuit described in the 2005 paper by Holger Müller titled 'Fast High-Voltage Amplifiers for Driving Electro-Optic Modulators'.
* A link to the original paper can be found at the bottom of this page.
